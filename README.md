# dynamic_clamp_workshop
Workshop on the dynamic clamp technique for the Berlin-Oxford Phd meeting 28-29th of March 2019


## program

### 15:00 - 15:10 Closing the theo-exp loop
* are you **T** or **E**?
* collect expertise on the board

### 15:00 - 15:25 Dynamic clamp 101

### 15:25 - 15:50 Discussion: Applications of the dynamic clamp
* Simulation of in vivo synaptic input in slice recordings
* 
### 15:50 - 16:05 Speed up and slow down neurons with the capacitance clamp 
* chalk talk: how to clamp a neuron's capacitance
* demonstration of the capacitance clamp in [RELACS](http://relacs.sourceforge.net/index.html)

### 16:05 - 16:30 Brainstorming: Loops beyond the dynamic clamp
* pair up theory and experimental backgrounds
* brainstorm on possible closed loops between soft- and wetware (15 mins)
* short presentations (10 mins)
